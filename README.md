CodeSync demonstrates a production-oriented collaborative editing web app built on the MERN stack with 
real-time capabilities using WebSockets and secure JWT authentication. The application balances fast, reactive 
collaboration features (live presence, cursors, real-time patches) with persistent versioning and secure access 
controls. From here you can extend the project by adding CRDT/OT for stronger conflict handling, file 
attachments, fine-grained permission controls, and mobile clients..
